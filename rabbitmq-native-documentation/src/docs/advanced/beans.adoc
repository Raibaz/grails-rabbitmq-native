=== Spring Beans

The are several beans defined by the plugin to perform its various operations.

|===
| Bean Name | Purpose
| `rabbitContext`             | A front-end class to the plugin that aggregates useful functionality for users of the
                                plugin.  Besides the `rabbitMessagePublisher`, this is likely the only bean users will
                                need to access, if at all.
| `connectionManager`         | Manages the lifecycle of connection instances, including loading, starting, stopping,
                                unloading, and retrieval.
| `messageConverterManager`   | Handles loading message converters and acts as the entry point when message conversion
                                is required.
| `consumerManager`           | Manages the lifecycle of consumer instances, including loading, starting, stopping,
                                unloading, and retrieval.
| `queueBuilder`              | Responsible for creating exchanges and queues defined in the application's configuration.
| `rabbitMessagePublisher`    | Used to send messages to a RabbitMQ broker.
