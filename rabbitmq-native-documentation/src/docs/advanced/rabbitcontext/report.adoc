==== Status Report

The `RabbitContext` contains a method `getStatusReport()`, which will build an object structure
containing information about all RabbitMQ connections and all consumers. This information is useful
to monitor the status of the RabbitMQ application system, as it contains running states and statistics including
how many concurrent threads a consumer is configured for, how many are actually active, and how many are actively
processing messages.  Below is an example of its output gathered from one of the plugin's tests, serialized as JSON.
