==== Starting and Stopping Consumers

Much like connections, the `rabbitContext` provides several methods to start and stop consumers if necessary.

|===
| Method | Description
| `startConsumers`            | Starts all registered consumers.  If some consumers are already started, the remainder
                                will also be started.
| `stopConsumers`             | Stops all consumers.
| `startConsumer`             | Starts a connection based on its class name.
| `stopConsumer`              | Stops a connection based on its class name.
| `startConsumers(String)`    | Starts all consumers on a specific connection, based on the connection name.
| `stopConsumers(String)`     | Stops all consumers on a specific connection, based on the connection name.
