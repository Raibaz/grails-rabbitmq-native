==== Native Objects

The main goal of the plugin is to effectively wrap the RabbitMQ library to hide the complexity of its usage and
make using it more inline with the conventions of Grails applications, but also allow users to gain access to the
underlying RabbitMQ objects if needed.  `rabbitContext` provides several methods to gain direct access to the
RabbitMQ Java library `Connection` and `Channel` objects.

To create a new `Channel`, use the `createChannel` methods.

[source,groovy]
-----
// This creates a new channel with the default connection
Channel channel = rabbitContext.createChannel()

// The same using a different connection based on its name
Channel channel = rabbitContext.createChannel("connection1")
-----

WARNING: If the `createChannel` methods are used, it is important that these channels are closed. The plugin handles opening
and closing channels that it manages as part of publishing or consuming messages, but channels created with the
`createChannel` methods are not managed by the plugin.  It is the author's responsibility to close them, or connection
leaks may and memory leaks most likely will occur.


Use the `getConnection` methods to gain access to the `Connection` objects.

[source,groovy]
-----
// To retrieve the Connection from the default connection
Connection connection = rabbitContext.getConnection()

// To retrieve the Connection from a specific connection based on its name
Connection connection = rabbitContext.getConnection("connection1")
