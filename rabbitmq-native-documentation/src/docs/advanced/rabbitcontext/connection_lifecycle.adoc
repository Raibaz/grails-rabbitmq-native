==== Starting and Stopping Connections

The plugin handles starting and stopping connections automatically when the application is started or shut down, but
sometimes applications may need to manually stop connections based on certain conditions or business logic. The
`rabbitContext` contains several methods to manage the life cycle of connections.

|===
| Method | Description
| `startConnections`  | Starts all registered connections.  If some connections are already started, the remainder
                        will also be started.
| `stopConnections`   | Stops all connections and all consumers.
| `startConnection`   | Starts a connection based on its name.
| `stopConnection`    | Stops a connection based on its name, and stops any consumers on the connection.
