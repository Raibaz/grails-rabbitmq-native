=== Sending Messages

Sending a message means publishing a message to an exchange or queue and not waiting for a response (fire and forget). The only required parameters to the publisher
are a queue or exchange to publish the message to, and the body of the message.

import com.budjb.rabbitmq.publisher.RabbitMessagePublisher

class ExampleService {
    RabbitMessagePublisher rabbitMessagePublisher

    def sendSomeMessage() {
        rabbitMessagePublisher.send {
            exchange = "some.exchange"
            routingKey = "some.routingKey"
            body = "hi!"
        }
    }
}

RabbitMQ expects the body of a message to be a byte array. Message converters will also work when publishing messages, so if an object type other than `byte[]` is
encountered, a suitable message converter will be found and run against the message body, if one exists.
