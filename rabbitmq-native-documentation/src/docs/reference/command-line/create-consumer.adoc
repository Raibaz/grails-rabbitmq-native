==== create-consumer

The `create-consumer` command creates a new consumer or consumers.

[source,bash]
grails create-consumer com.example.Test

This command is useful to quickly create new consumers, in much the same way as Grails' built-in commands to create new controllers, domains, etc. The generated file is a template that is ready to be configured and used,
and includes a generic message handler.

A powerful feature of this script is the ability to create as many consumers as are entered on the command line. For example:

[source,bash]
grails create-consumer com.example.First com.example.Second


The above will create two consumers: `FirstConsumer` and `SecondConsumer`.
