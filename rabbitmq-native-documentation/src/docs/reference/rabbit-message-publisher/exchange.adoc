==== exchange

Define the exchange to publish a message to.

[source,groovy]
rabbitMessagePublisher.send {
    exchange = "example.exchange"
    body = "message"
}

Setting this property lets the `rabbitMessagePublisher` know to publish the message to an exchange. Depending on the type of exchange, the use of the <<routingKey>>
property may be necessary. See the RabbitMQ documentation for more information on exchanges.

NOTE: A publish operation with the `rabbitMessagePublisher` may only be done with either an exchange or a queue, but not both.  Attempting to use both will result in an error.
