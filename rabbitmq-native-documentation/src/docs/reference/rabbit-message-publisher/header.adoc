==== headers

Attached headers to send with the message.

[source,groovy]
rabbitMessagePublisher.send {
    routingKey = "example.queue"
    headers = [
        "header1": "foo",
        "header2": "bar"
    }
    body = "test message"
}

The headers property is simply a map with key/value pairs for the header names and their values.
