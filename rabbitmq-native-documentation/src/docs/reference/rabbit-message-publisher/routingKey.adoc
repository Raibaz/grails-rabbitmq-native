==== routingKey

The routing key is used in conjunction with an exchange to publish a message.

[source,groovy]
rabbitMessagePublisher.send {
    exchange = "example.exchange"
    routingKey = "example.topic"
    body = "message"
}

The routing key is useful when publishing messages to *topic* or *direct* exchanges. When used on *direct* exchanges, the routing key must match
the binding a queue used to bind to an exchange, or the message will become unroutable (and possibly lost). See the RabbitMQ documentation for
more information on routing keys and exchanges.

The `exchange` can be omitted, in which case the `routingKey` can be used to send a message directly to a queue.
