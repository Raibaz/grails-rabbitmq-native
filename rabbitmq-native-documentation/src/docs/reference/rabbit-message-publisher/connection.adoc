==== connection

Sets which connection should be used to send the message to.

[source,groovy]
rabbitMessagePublisher.send {
    exchange = "example.exchange"
    routingKey = "example.topic"
    body = "message"
    connection = "server1"
}

The connection property is used to specify which server to send a message with in a multi-server configuration.
If the connection is omitted, the default connection will be used.
