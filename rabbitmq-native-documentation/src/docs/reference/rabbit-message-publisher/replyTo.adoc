==== replyTo

Sets the replyTo queue name.

[source,groovy]
rabbitMessagePublisher.send {
    routingKey = "example.queue"
    replyTo = "reply.queue"
    body = "test message"
}

Setting the `replyTo` property of the message lets the consumer know that the publisher expects a response to the message. The value of this property should be an existent queue the client is consuming on.

NOTE: This property is automatically set when the `RabbitMessagePublisher.rpc()` method is used, and the consumer has access to this property to reply to the message.
