==== body

Body of the message to send to the RabbitMQ server.

[source,groovy]
rabbitMessagePublisher.send {
    routingKey = "example.queue"
    body = "test message"
}

The body is a required part of the message to transmit. The RabbitMQ server expects the message to be in a byte array format, but the plugin attempts to handle the conversion of objects for you via the
<<Message Converters>> objects. You may assign any type of object to this property as long as there is a message converter available to convert the object to a byte array.
