==== match

Set the match criteria to use when subscribing to a headers exchange.

[source,groovy]
static rabbitConfig = [
    exchange: "example.exchange",
    binding: ["foo": "bar"],
    match: "any"
]

The match property determines with any one header must match or whether all headers must match for the queue's binding. This property
is only used when binding to a headers exchange.
