==== consumers

Set the number of concurrent consumers the message consumer should start.

[source,groovy]
static rabbitConfig = [
    queue: "example.queue",
    consumers: 10
]

By default, a message consumer class will only start one consumer. This means the consumer can only handle one message at a time. Authors can increase the number of concurrent consumers are running by
increasing the value of this property.
