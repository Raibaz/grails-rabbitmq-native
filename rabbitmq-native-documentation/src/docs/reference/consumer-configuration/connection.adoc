==== connection

Sets which connection should be used to consume messages from.

[source,groovy]
static rabbitConfig = [
    queue: "foobar",
    connection: "server1"
]

The connection property should be used in multi-server configurations to specify which connection should be used to consume messages from.
If the connection property is omitted, the default connection will be used.
