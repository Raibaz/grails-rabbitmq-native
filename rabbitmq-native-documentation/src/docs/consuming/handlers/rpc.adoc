==== RPC-Style Messages

When a client publishes a message and waits for a return reply, this is considered an RPC-style operation. Typically, the server-side of the operation (in this case, a message consumer/handler) must
respond to the client on a queue that the client requested manually. This plugin provides a very convenient method to respond to the client without having to manually construct a response message.

The client will provide a response queue to the server to reply to. This queue name is stored in the `MessageContext.properties.replyTo` variable. If a client publishes
this variable, and the handler returns some data, the plugin will convert the data returned from the message handler and build a response message for you.

The following example illustrates responding via a handler's returned data.

[source,groovy]
-----
class RpcExampleConsumer {
    def handleMessage(String message, MessageContext messageContext) {
        println "received ${message}"

        return "response" // this message will be sent back to the consumer via its replyTo queue
    }
}
-----

Alternatively, the `rabbitMessagePublisher` can be used to respond.

[source,groovy]
-----
class RpcExampleConsumer {
    def rabbitMessagePublisher

    def handleMessage(String message, MessageContext messageContext) {
        println "received ${message}"

        rabbitMessagePublisher.send {
            routingKey: messageContext.properties.replyTo
            body: "response"
        }
    }
}
-----

NOTE: Allowing the plugin to build a reply message only converts the data returned from the message handler and publishes it to the reply queue. If you need to set any of the other message properties,
like headers, content-types, etc, you must manually build the response message using the `rabbitMessagePublisher`, and refrain from returning data from the message handler.
