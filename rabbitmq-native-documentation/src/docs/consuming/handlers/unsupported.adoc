==== Handling Unsupported Messages

As long as there is a converter that can convert an incoming message and a handler defined that accepts the converted
object, messages can be delivered. In the case where an incoming message can not be converted and there is no possible
way to provide the message to a handler, an error is logged by default and the message is rejected.

Message consumers that need to conduct some logic when this occurs may implement the `UnsupportedMessageHandler`
interface, which requires the `handleUnsupportedMessage` method. When no handler and converter exist for a message,
this method is called and the `MessageContext` is passed in, giving the consumer some way to gracefully handle input
failures. Objects may even be returned, much like regular handlers, as a response to an RPC call.
