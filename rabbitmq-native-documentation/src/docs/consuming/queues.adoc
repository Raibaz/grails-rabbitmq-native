=== Subscribing To Queues
Message consumers can subscribe to either queues or exchanges. When a consumer is registered to a queue, the consumer will receive messages from the queue as
the RabbitMQ server determines that it's the consumer's turn to receive a message, since there may be multiple listeners on the same queue.

Each message consumer class must have a configuration defined. There are 2 methods to specify the configuration:

* The consumer class can have a `Map` assigned to a static variable named `rabbitConfig`. To subscribe to queues, the only required configuration option is the `queue` variable, which is the name of the queue to subscribe to.
* The application's configuration file can contain the configuration with the path `rabbitmq.consumers.<ClassName>`.  See the section below for more details.

Here is a simple example of a consumer subscribing to a queue.

[source,groovy]
-----
package com.example

import com.budjb.rabbitmq.consumer.MessageContext

class ExampleConsumer {
    static rabbitConfig = [
        "queue": "test.queue"
    ]

    def handleMessage(def body, MessageContext context) {
        // Process message
    }
}

There are many options available to influence how the consumer works, which can be found in the reference.
