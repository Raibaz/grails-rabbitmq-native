==== Topic Exchanges

A topic exchange will forward messages to queues based on the binding criteria the queue used to register to the exchange. In RabbitMQ terms,
this is called a routing key. The routing key can be either a direct match, or utilize wildcards to do a partial topic match. If a routing key
is omitted, the queue will receive no messages. Use `"#"` to receive all messages from an exchange.
More information can be found in the RabbitMQ documentation.

    def handleMessage(def body, MessageContext context) {
        // Process message
    }
