==== Headers Exchanges

Header exchanges work similarly to topic exchanges. A headers exchange will forward messages to queues based on header values contained
in messages. Additionally, a queue can be bound on multiple header values, along with an option to require one or all of the headers
to match.

package com.example

class ExampleConsumer {
    static rabbitConfig = [
        "exchange": "headers.exchange",
        "binding": [
            "foo": "bar",
            "hi": "there"
        ],
        "match": "any"
    ]

    def handleMessage(def body, MessageContext context) {
        // Process message
    }
}
