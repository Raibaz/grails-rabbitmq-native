=== Central Configuration

It is also possible to define the consumer's configuration outside of the consumer in the application's configuration
file.  All of the configuration options described above are valid for this type of configuration. This functionality is
valuable when a consumer's configuration needs to be determined at runtime, instead of being hardcoded in the consumer
class itself.

To configuration a consumer in the Grails application's configuration file, an entry matching the consumer's class name
should be present under the `rabbitmq.consumers` key, as follows:

.application.groovy
[source,groovy]
rabbitmq {
    consumers {
        ExampleConsumer {
            queue = "test.queue"
        }
    }
}


.application.yml
[source,yaml]
rabbitmq:
    consumers:
        ExampleConsumer:
            queue: test.queue
