=== Defining Exchanges

Defining exchanges is very similar to defining queues. The following code illustrates how to define an exchange:

.application.groovy
[source,groovy]
rabbitmq {
    exchanges = [
        [
            name: "example.exchange",
            type: "topic"
        ]
    ]
}

.application.yml
[source,yaml]
rabbitmq:
    exchanges:
      - name: example.exchange
        type: topic

The above example will create an exchange with the name *example.exchange* and of the type *topic*. Below is a list of
all the options available when creating exchanges:
