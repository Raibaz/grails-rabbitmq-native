=== From 3.0.X

The upgrade from 3.0.X to 3.1.X includes a refactor of how the consumer and connection managers work.
The storage of consumer handlers was moved from the connection classes into the consumer manager in order
to support the new start/stop functionality, and it made sense for consumer handlers to reside with
the appropriately named manager.

Both of the managers also now have underlying interfaces that define how a manager should behave. In addition,
the objects being managed are now called *Contexts*, which also have interfaces that define their general
behavior.  It is the intention that with these changes the plugin becomes more stable with less backwards-
compatibility breaking changes being introduced moving forward.

Here are the items authors may need to address when upgrading to this version of the plugin.

* The `rabbitContext.getConnection()` methods now return the RabbitMQ `Connection` object instead of
  the `ConnectionContext` instance.  This was done to make the methods more consistent with the
  `createChannel` methods and to encapsulate the `ConnectionContext` objects inside the manager.
  The `ConnectionContext` objects can now be retrieved from the `consumerManager` bean.
* Many of the methods inside of the `ConsumerManager` and `ConnectionManager` have been renamed to adhere
  to a common interface.  This should only affect projects that use these beans directly.
* Some of the methods inside of the `RabbitContext` have been renamed to match the interface used by
  the various managers.

Overall, users of the plugin should see no impact if the `rabbitContext` or any of the other beans are
not used in their projects.

If the use of the plugin's beans is limited to the `rabbitContext`, the impact should be minimal,
with some minor changes need to method names and some refactored code if retrieving a `ConnectionContext`.
Users that use the other manager beans will need to account for the changed interface implemented by
those beans.
